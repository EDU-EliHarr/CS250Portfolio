How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs into a program involves understanding the end user's goals, pain points, and the context in which they will use the software. 
Creating "user stories" is pivotal in this process as it transforms abstract needs into concrete, actionable items. By breaking down requirements into 
user stories, developers can prioritize work based on the impact on the user, ensuring that the most critical features are implemented first.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is iterative, focusing on delivering functional increments of the software. I want to develop the most basic form 
of the program first, so I can activly view and test the changes I am making to the software. I want to incorperate sprint planning in my future work, 
since it helps in breaking down the work into manageable chunks that can be completed within short cycles, enabling regular feedback and adjustments. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means more than just having technical skills. It involves effective communication, collaboration, and
a willingness to learn and adapt. A good team member actively listens to others, contributes ideas, and respects the diverse skill sets within the team.
